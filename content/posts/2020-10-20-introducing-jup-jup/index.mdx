# Introducing JupJup

**Jackie:**
Sup guys. It's Jackie, your favorite fluffy author of this wonderful blog.
Just wanted to let you know how I came to know so much stuff about Koh Phangan.
I came to KP a year and a half ago. I really like looking into every nook and
cranny and discovering what I can get for one baht two baht 20 baht, 100 million
baht and better yet: the priceless sights. So, I've been wandering around the
island discovering all of these small pockets of the universe, which I can feel
cozy in and share with you guys as well.

The reason why we all came together was our dear friend Shawn the co-author
here, sitting right next to me kept bothering me with all these questions like:
Hmm, where can I get coconut water with the flesh meat taken out?
Hmm, where can I get neon green board shorts? Hmm, where can I get that visor
that’s on your head because I keep stealing it from you?
And instead of constantly being bothered with all of these questions we thought
we can just collect it in one place.
Shawn has a very unique collection of things he's been acquiring throughout the
island and I'll actually bring the mic over to him so you can know a little bit
more about him.

**Shawn:**
So right, it's exactly what she said, I can never remember where to go and get
the best things because I want to get the best things for the best prices. This
is important. And I've been doing software development for a while and thought:
you know, we can take the wisdom that Jackie has and my tech background and
create something we can all share.

Jackie and I met at a Kali workshop and bonded instantaneously. Our other
author/ illustrator Soölenn, I met because I wanted a guitar and she was
selling a cheap guitar. She’s awesome and a great Illustrator. And really
happy that she can join us on this adventure also.

Yeah, that's us 3 and we'll be guiding you through all the weird and wild on
the island.

Love you guys,
The jup jups
